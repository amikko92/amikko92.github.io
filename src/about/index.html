                    My name is Andreas Mikko. I grew up in the small town of Kiruna in northern Sweden.
                    But these days I live in Trollhättan together with my wife and daughter.

                    My development journey started in my final year of high school. Were I made a simple
                    space shooter game with Game Maker. This first project motivated
                    me to pursue a University degree in game development. Game design was my initial plan
                    but I eventually realized I had a greater talent for programming rather than design.
                </p>

                    Currently, I work as a Lead Engineer at Evolution in Gothenburg, Sweden.
                    Where I make slot games under the Netent brand.
                    Previous merits include lecturing at Södertörn University and Microsoft 
                    Azure development at Semcon.
