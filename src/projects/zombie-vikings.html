                    In 2014, I had an internship at Zoink. Or 
                    <a href="https://thunderfulgames.com/">Thunderful</a>
                    as they are known as these days. Initially I was tasked with working on prototypes for games in early
                    concept stage. But soon I was moved over to contribute on Zoink's next big game
                    <a href="https://thunderfulgames.com/games/zombie-vikings/">Zombie Vikings</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    They were putting together a presentation video and wanted to feature a boss character. Some animations 
                    had been prepared that needed to run. "Just play them. The boss fight doesn't need to be functional".
                    I implemented the animations and before I knew it I was tasked with making the boss functional as well.
                    The boss in question was the naked witch in the cauldron. You square off against her early in the game.

                    During my time at Zoink I had my first taste of professional game development. Working alongside
                    industry professionals was insightful and I got a chance to deepen my experience with the Unity game
                    engine and the C# programming language.
