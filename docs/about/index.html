                    My name is <strong>Andreas Mikko</strong>. I grew up in the small town of Kiruna in northern Sweden.
                    But these days I live in <strong>Trollh√§ttan</strong> together with my wife and daughter. Although, I
                    enjoy the occasional commute to <strong>Gothenburg</strong> for my day job as a developer.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    My development journey started in my final year of high school. Were I made a simple
                    space shooter game with <strong>Game Maker</strong>. This first project motivated
                    me to pursue a University degree in game development. Game design was my initial plan
                    but I eventually realized I had a greater talent for programming rather than design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first introduction programming came in the form of <strong>C++</strong> at the university. But 
                    soon I transitioned over to focus more on <strong>C#</strong>. First using the excellent 
                    <strong>XNA framework</strong> and eventually <strong>Unity</strong>. More traditional 
                    .Net development would follow at my first job at <strong>Semcon</strong>.
                    Which included a backend for electric car chargers on the <strong>Azure</strong> cloud platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I work as a <strong>Lead Engineer at Evolution</strong>.
                    Where I make slot games under the Netent brand. As a result, my focus these days is on frontend 
                    web technologies and a lot of <strong>TypeScript</strong>.
