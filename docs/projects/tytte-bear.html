                    is a game I developed using Unity back in 2015.
                    Initially it was released for Android devices on 
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GironGames.TytteBear">Google Play</a>.
                    Later it was made playable in the browser on <a href="https://girongames.itch.io/tytte-bear">Itch.io</a>.

                    Tytte Bear was developed as part of my one man start-up attempt Giron Games.
                    At the end of 2014, my contract as Junior Lecturer at Södertörn University was 
                    coming to an end. At the time I had a strong urge to resume my own studies for a Masters degree.
                    However, I had roughly half a year of time to kill. Finding a "regular" job for just a few months
                    didn't seem appealing. So why not try starting my own game company?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Said and done. I attended seminars to learn more about starting and running a business. I registered 
                    a company with the Swedish Tax Agency. Managed book keeping and tried to wrap my head around VAT-rules.
                    While also designing and developing the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After six months of development. I had realized I didn't enjoy the business side of things. 
                    I rather focus on coding on the game. Besides university studies were around the corner which 
                    would take most of my attention. Thus I took the decision to wrap up Tytte Bear and release it as is.
                    At the same time I unregistered the company and shut it down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will I ever attempt a start-up again? Probably not. At least not solo. With Tytte Bear I had help
                    with the art. Otherwise I did everything myself. In a hypothetical future start-up I would want to
                    have the support of a well rounded team so I can focus more on the technical aspects.
